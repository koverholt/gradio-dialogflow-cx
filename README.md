   ```
3. Open the notebook
4. Define the values in the notebook for your Google Cloud project ID,
   Dialogflow CX agent region, Dialogflow CX agent ID, and language. For
   example:
   ```
   PROJECT_ID = "my-awesome-google-cloud-project"
   LOCATION_ID = "global"

   LANGUAGE_CODE = "en-us"
   ```
5. Run all of the cells in the notebook
6. View the app in your browser on your local machine
7. (Optional) Make your Gradio app link publicly accessible by running a new
   cell with `demo.launch(share=True)`
